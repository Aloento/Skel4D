## Abstract Summary

Zero123++ is an advanced image-conditioned diffusion model designed to generate 3D-consistent multi-view images from a single input view. The model builds upon Stable Diffusion and addresses key limitations of Zero-1-to-3 (Zero123) by improving multi-view consistency and leveraging better conditioning mechanisms. It excels at producing high-quality, geometrically consistent multi-view images while overcoming common issues like texture degradation and geometric misalignment.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Multi-view Generation Strategy
- **Problem**: Zero-1-to-3 generates each novel view independently, leading to inconsistency
- **Solution**: Tiles 6 views into a single image with a 3×2 layout to model joint distribution
- **Camera Poses**: Uses fixed absolute elevation angles (30° downward, 20° upward) and relative azimuth angles (starting at 30°, incrementing by 60°)
- **Benefit**: Eliminates orientation ambiguity without requiring additional elevation estimation

### 2. Improved Noise Schedule
- **Problem**: Stable Diffusion's scaled-linear schedule emphasizes local details but has few low SNR steps
- **Solution**: Switches to linear noise schedule for better global consistency
- **Base Model**: Uses Stable Diffusion 2 v-prediction model for better stability when swapping schedules
- **Insight**: Linear schedule provides more emphasis on global structure crucial for multi-view consistency

### 3. Scaled Reference Attention (Local Conditioning)
- **Problem**: Zero-1-to-3's concatenation approach imposes incorrect pixel-wise correspondence
- **Solution**: Implements Reference Attention with scaled latents (5x scaling factor)
- **Mechanism**: 
  - Runs UNet on reference image with same noise level
  - Appends self-attention keys/values from reference to corresponding layers
  - Enables proper local conditioning without spatial correspondence assumptions

### 4. FlexDiffuse Global Conditioning
- **Problem**: Need to incorporate global image information into text-conditioned model
- **Solution**: Trainable variant of FlexDiffuse linear guidance
- **Implementation**:
  ```
  T'_i = T_i + w_i * I
  ```
  where T is prompt embeddings, I is CLIP global image embedding, w_i are trainable weights
- **Initialization**: Uses linear ramping: w_i = i/L

### 5. Training Strategy
- **Phased Training**: 
  - Phase 1: Only tune self-attention layers and KV matrices of cross-attention
  - Phase 2: Conservative full UNet tuning with very low learning rate (5×10^-6)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with cosine annealing (peak: 7×10^-5)
- **Dataset**: Objaverse with random HDRI environment lighting
- **Loss**: Min-SNR weighting strategy for efficient training

## Technical Implementation Details

  - Real photographs
  - AI-generated images (SDXL)
  - 2D illustrations and anime art

## Applications and Extensions

### 1. Text-to-Multi-view Pipeline
- Combine SDXL text-to-image generation with Zero123++
- Produces realistic, consistent multi-view images from text prompts
- Avoids cartoonish texture bias seen in MVDream

### 2. Depth ControlNet
- Additional ControlNet trained on normalized linear depth images
- Enables geometry-guided generation
- Two modes:
  - Single view + depth guidance
  - Pure geometry-to-multi-view generation

### 3. 3D Reconstruction
- Multi-view images can be used for high-quality mesh generation
- Bridges gap between 2D generation and 3D content creation

## Future Directions

1. **Two-stage Refiner Model**: Use ε-parameterized SDXL as refiner for better local details
2. **Scaling Up**: Train on larger datasets like Objaverse-XL (10M+ objects)
3. **Mesh Reconstruction**: Improve direct 3D mesh generation from multi-view outputs

## Technical Advantages

### Over Zero-1-to-3:
- **Consistency**: Joint distribution modeling vs. independent generation
- **Quality**: Better preservation of Stable Diffusion priors
- **Stability**: Improved training at native resolution (320px)
- **Generalization**: Better handling of out-of-domain inputs

### Design Innovations:
- **Noise Schedule**: Linear vs. scaled-linear for global structure emphasis
- **Conditioning**: Proper separation of local (reference attention) and global (FlexDiffuse) conditioning
- **Training**: Phased approach preserving pre-trained capabilities
